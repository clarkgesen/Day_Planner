# Day_Planner
    An editable day planner that holds appointments for the 8 hours of a weekday

# Editable and Savable
    Each hour block has an editable area for setting tasks. The save button next to each text field will then save the appointments to local storage.

# Color coded hours
    The hour blocks are color coded to show if the time-block is in the past, present, or future. The past is in grey, present is in red, and the future is in green.
